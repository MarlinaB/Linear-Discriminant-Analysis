# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction and classification technique used in statistics, machine learning, and pattern recognition. It's particularly useful for supervised classification problems.

# Benefits of Linear Discriminant Analysis:
 @ LDA can significantly improve classification accuracy when there is a clear separation between classes.
 @ It's useful for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving class separability, which can help reduce the "curse of dimensionality."
 @ LDA provides insights into the most discriminative features in the dataset.
